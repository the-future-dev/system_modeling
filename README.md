## Dynamical Systems Checklist for Simulation

- [x] **Mass-Spring-Damper System**
  - Description: A foundational model in classical mechanics where a mass is attached to a spring and a damper.
  - Equations: Typically derived using Newton's second law of motion.
  - Features: Demonstrates behaviors like simple harmonic motion, damping, and forced vibrations.

- [ ] **Simple Pendulum**
  - Description: A mass hanging from a pivot that can oscillate due to gravity.
  - Equations: Derived using Newtonian mechanics or the Lagrangian approach.
  - Features: Demonstrates simple harmonic motion, especially when damping and driven forces are excluded.

- [ ] **Double Pendulum**
  - Description: A pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end.
  - Equations: Usually modeled using Lagrangian mechanics.
  - Features: Nonlinear dynamics, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and chaotic behavior for certain parameters.
