## Dynamical Systems Checklist for Simulation

- [x] **Mass-Spring-Damper System**
  - Description: A foundational model in classical mechanics where a mass is attached to a spring and a damper.
  - Equations: Typically derived using Newton's second law of motion.
  - Features: Demonstrates behaviors like simple harmonic motion, damping, and forced vibrations.

- [ ] **Simple Pendulum**
  - Description: A mass hanging from a pivot that can oscillate due to gravity.
  - Equations: Derived using Newtonian mechanics or the Lagrangian approach.
  - Features: Demonstrates simple harmonic motion, especially when damping and driven forces are excluded.

- [ ] **Double Pendulum**
  - Description: A pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end.
  - Equations: Usually modeled using Lagrangian mechanics.
  - Features: Nonlinear dynamics, sensitive dependence on initial conditions, and chaotic behavior for certain parameters.

- [ ] **Van der Pol Oscillator**
  - Description: A non-conservative oscillator with non-linear damping.
  - Equations: Characterized by a second-order differential equation.
  - Features: It produces limit cycles and is used in circuits and cardiac rhythms.

- [ ] **Lorenz System**
  - Description: A simple mathematical model for atmospheric convection and weather patterns.
  - Equations: Three coupled non-linear differential equations.
  - Features: The famous "butterfly effect," chaotic behavior, and the Lorenz attractor.

- [ ] **Lotka-Volterra Equations (Predator-Prey Model)**
  - Description: A biological model describing the dynamics of predator-prey interactions in ecosystems.
  - Equations: A set of first-order, non-linear differential equations.
  - Features: Oscillatory behavior, coexistence equilibria, and potential extinction events.

- [ ] **Duffing Oscillator**
  - Description: A driven damped harmonic oscillator with a cubic non-linearity.
  - Equations: Non-linear second-order differential equation.
  - Features: Demonstrates complex behavior such as period doubling, chaos, and strange attractors.

- [ ] **Rossler Attractor**
  - Description: A system of three non-linear ordinary differential equations.
  - Equations: Simpler than the Lorenz system but exhibits chaotic behavior.
  - Features: Commonly studied in chaos theory, it has a unique folded structure.

- [ ] **Three Body Problem**
  - Description: Predict the motions of three celestial bodies interacting only with one another.
  - Equations: Newtonian equations of motion.
  - Features: Even with just three bodies, the system is chaotic and general solutions can't be derived.

- [ ] **SIR Model in Epidemiology**
  - Description: Models the spread of an infectious disease through a population.
  - Equations: Set of ordinary differential equations describing the susceptible, infectious, and recovered populations.
  - Features: Useful for understanding disease spread dynamics, herd immunity, and effects of vaccination.
